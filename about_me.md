### Nick Smith  
### Director of Escalation Management Team, which includes the Support Incident Coordinators and the Senior Escalation Engineers
Based in Cornwall, SW of UK - well known for it's surfing, ice cream and Poldark - a man returns from war to find his GF has dumped him for his best friend... tricky best man speach. Catch up on BBC iPlayer.

### My strengths include 
1. building teams through psychological safety, purpose, inclusion, autonomy, recognition and growth. I have a [website](https://deliberate-leadership.uk/) dedicated to this. 
2. coaching people to pursue their version of success. This is the stuff I love and focus increasingly on.

### Outside of work
Father, grandfather, married with 2 dogs. Always trying to be a better human - love reading and listening to non-fiction etc. 
I volunteer as an animal care assistant for [National Animal Welfare Trust](https://www.nawt.org.uk/our-services/our-centres/nawt-cornwall/) and as a marine mammal medic for the [British Divers Marine Life Rescue](https://bdmlr.org.uk/). I'm dog obsessed and have been learning [Krav Maga](https://kravmagacornwall.com/).
