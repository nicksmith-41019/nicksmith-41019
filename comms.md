## Best Practices
- **Weekly Digest**: Summary of key updates posted in `#support-announcements`
- **Incident Reviews**: Held weekly; notes stored in Confluence and linked in Slack
- **Documentation First**: All new processes must be documented in `support-docs` before rollout
- **Slack â‰  Source of Truth**: Always link to GitHub or Confluence for canonical info
